* Philosophies
In order to stand the test of time, there are philosophies and codes of conduct a man must adhere to. Vu is no
exception. When it comes to softwares, these are the things that has been driving
him towards greatness (or at least that's what he thinks):

- Aestheticism matters
- Conciseness is good
- Explicitness is great
- More codes = more bugs
- Mathematical proof trumps everything
- Engineering principles are far more important than stacks and tools
- Have some Taste!
